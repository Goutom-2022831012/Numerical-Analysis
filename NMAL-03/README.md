üßÆThe Newton-Raphson Method is an efficient and widely used iterative technique for finding approximate roots of a real-valued function f(x) = 0. It starts with an initial guess x‚ÇÄ and generates successively better approximations using the formula:
x‚Çô‚Çä‚ÇÅ = x‚Çô ‚àí f(x‚Çô) / f‚Ä≤(x‚Çô)

This method relies on both the function and its first derivative. At each step, it computes the tangent line to the curve at the current estimate and uses its x-intercept as the next estimate. The Newton-Raphson Method is fast and efficient but requires the derivative and a good initial guess. It may fail or diverge if the derivative is zero or the guess is poor.
